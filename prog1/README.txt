This program is a scheme pretty printer that will read a scheme program,
parse it, and print it back out onto standard output that is indented in
a uniform style

The code design consists of the following:
-a lexical analyzer that converts input text into tokens
-a parser that reads the input and builds a corresponding parse tree
-a parse-tree traversal that pretty-prints the input

Scanner.java works properly however, in a few of our own personal
test cases it encounters a problem when a right paranthesis is not
preceded with a white space

Parser.java parses and runs correctly however prints incorrectly for test
cases 2 and 3 due to an error related to printing in Cons.java (Line 73)
