This Program is a simple Scheme interpreter in Java

The code design consists of the following:
-the code from Project 1 is what we are building on top of
-class environment to keep track of variables during evaluation
-evaulation functions for all Special classes and some Tree classes
-evaluation functions consist of a Scheme expression and an environment
-implemeneted eval function with a top-level loop directly in main function

1 test successful, 2 tests failed, 0 tests ecnountered errors. 
Test 1 runs successfully however Tests 2  and 3 do not. Test 2 fails 
during node evaluation and does not print correctly. Test 3 
encounters a problem when the factorial function fails.
